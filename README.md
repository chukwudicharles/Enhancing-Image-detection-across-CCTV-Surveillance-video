# Enhancing-Image-detection-across-CCTV-Surveillance-video
This projects builds a model that can detect number of times an image or similar, appears accross a bunch of CCTV videos (a computer vision project).
It uses YOLOv5 pretrained model for object detection in image and videos after cropping them
It uses ReNet pre-trained model to extract embeddings from image and videos, these embeddings are compared to detect similarities
